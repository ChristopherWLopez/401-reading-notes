## What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

EventEmitter

## What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

This allows us to control the flow and really not muddy up the process and need to reach inside an individual function. We are able to make sure that we can use methods that hide inside other objets in a way that we want them by registering them with the `emit` key. This allows us to control them and how they react as well as grant them easy access to those methods.

## Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js

Event driven programming is useful because often we havea chain of events that need to take place. often each individual event is an individual item that has its own set of properties... Be it clicking this certain page to go here then click that button to there. This is like the "natural flow", like when you are filling out a form. Its fairly easy to assume that you are going to click the form link, then start from the top and work your way to the bottom then hit submit. This requires a specific flow. Much like tapestry there is a million ways to get the string from one point to another but we have a more specific design that we want to accomplish, there for we can set ourselves up to make sure that we are being as effiencient and effective as possible.

## Notes

Event driven programming is a logical pattern we confine our programming in to avoid issues

to remove an event listener that is no longer needed we could use the "remove event listener method, in order to stop the down turn of performance or memory leaks

## Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

I am just wanting to grasp what is going on in eveny driven programming

## What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

There are somethings in the reading that I am unsure about and I think that having a better understanding would be amazing.

## Things I want to know more about

I just want to see an example of EDP. Because I am uncertain I understand this Baddy
