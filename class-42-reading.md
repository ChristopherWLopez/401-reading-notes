# Class 42 reading

## article 1

I read through some of the "code of ethics" (ACM) and this was really an interesting read. I see and understand the need for clear cut ethics and the importance of having them set into place. Im sure was situations where these ethics were broken and how this could of effected many users. I do completelty agree with pretty much all of what I read and as I mentioned above, i love that there is actually a code of ethics to ensure people are safe and that we as developers are looking out for not just fellow humans but most "importantly" nature. Though, i do feel that these ethics are awesome however I thing that they have been broked many times over. I cant help but feel that there has been many loopholes and ways that people have worded things differently in their defense and have likely paid out the right people to over look these issues. As stated above I love the goal to make sure we take care of nature, yet... I think there has been so much done under the umbrella of technological advancement yet tons of harm was done and is done to nature.

The aspect of securtity and being clear about the collection of data (and when it gets dispossed of) is a really big one to me, I dont like the collection of data, yet I understand why it is done at times and why It can actually help the user... But i also know that there has been write ups where they disclose data is the new "hot commodity" that is worth more than oil.

## article 2

I read about the `judgment` priniciple. Of course I did like alot of what I read about these principle and how they try and maintain a strong sense of integrity for the software dev community, as well as continue to serve the general public with integrity and responsibilty as well. Which is one reason why I chose to read this principle.

All n all YES I do agree that there needs to "temper all technical judgements by the need to support and maintain human  values. I did find it so interesting with the part about " not to engage in deceptive financial practices..." because I feel like as developers we are able to do our best to ensure that we are not taking parts in such acts yet I guess it falls on how our users USE our apps /software. From what I know there is "high frequency trading" apps that used to make trading stocks lightening fast, yet we have these traders who use this to really get a big headstart and often enough the little guy is left holding the bag. 

## Code im still ashamed of

This topic was really a big eye opener! This is something that as new developer you are so overwhelmed with the fact that you actually landed a job and your actually getting paid for something you wanted to do... or something that you paid alot of money for the schooling for. I do hold my principles close to me and I feel that there are companies that I know would not want to work for, because I just could not bring myself to do it.

This story was a reason to slow down and make sure that I know what I am doing and make sure that I do my research as to who I am working for and make the best decision I can based off of the info I am able to get.
