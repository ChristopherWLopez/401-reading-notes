# Class 9 Reading

Some rough Ideas.

I see and understand now (like David said in one of the lectures) that alot of what we do is the create and move data around. This is pretty interesting... I understand that is over simplifying things but its also not in correct.

- Record buyers/sellers : This would make for a market place for people to add, delete or edit their record collection. This would leave room for allowing only the sellers to be able to edit their listings while the readers would only have access to certain routes... I did say records, but I do think that this general "market place" is very interchangeable.
- I will always suggest something to do with food. Be it another food app (we made one in 201) where you are able find restaurants based off of what your wants or dietary restrictions are.
- I love Andras Idea and Im always about pet rescue's or ways to basically create an app that we are able to list/ read listings for adopting animals.
