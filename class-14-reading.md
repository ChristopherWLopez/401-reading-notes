# Reading notes class 14

I think the chat app is an interesting idea  that would be a feature for a future full length project.

I think also doing a battleship type game where you send your moves via a chat game would be pretty cheesey yet pretty fun to do.... This one is probably more of a long shot but I just want to throw the idea out there because the idea seems pretty fun.

a food delivery service that would work very closely to how the CAPS we did in class worked. 

## Reflection

Understanding how an event based messanger works would be pretty ineresting.
