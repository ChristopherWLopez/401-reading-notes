## What does Progressive in Progressive Web App mean?

This means that our platform specific apps(which usually feel as if they are apart of the machine they are working on) are working alongside "modern API's" this helps deliver the benefits of any platform specific app(These are often very reliable and can work with hardware attached via USB, can work even with weak connection, and can even use files stored on the users device) as well the capabilities and reliability and instabillity while having the reach that often comes with webapps.

## What are three benefits of writing a progressive web app, as opposed to a native app?

1.) We are able to increase the abilities that this app can do, this makes users feel much butter about the app because we are able top ensure that the app still does what it needs to at its core, 2.) this could really increase the amount of traffic and interation.

3.)This also helps the relaiabillity of the app (as stated above) we are able to make sure that the data that this app is used for is still accessible to the user, this could be very important especially if the user uses this app for work or anything that their livihood relys on.

## What are two reasons to consider a native app, instead of a PWA?

I think if connection was a big reason for an app (instead of interactivity like widgets). Then assuring the user has the constant reliablility for this app is a big deal.

I also think that maybe this app is just something that requires no one to interact with constantly, other than a simple "check-in".
