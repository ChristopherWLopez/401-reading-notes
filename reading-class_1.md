## How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

Node js is a way for us to execute JS (in the front end), this runs on any chrome based browser and overall this helps us run JS on our personal computers. This allows us to work with other frame works.This is helpful because in some cases when we want to create an app that interacts with a server we would need to learn another language (other than js)
however with NODE we get to use JS the whole time and it will run our commands we ask of it in the browser. There is another use when it comes to working on the serve side of things and this comes with the amount of times we ask our server to do a certaint thing for us. In some cases we would get a much slower respond if we used other languages for such things, however with noden we are able to make those requests and with the natural way that JS works We are able to make those requests base on a click of a button (an event) and then that event will gert pushed into a que (so to speak) and that event will happen, this free's us up from getting cloggeg up (which could happen in several intances where we are not using NODE).

## What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

Before we runtimes we used "enterpretures' which would interpret our JS code. However modern browsers have a js runtime built into it that allows us to run our js code AS IS and have it work.

## What is Node used for?

Node is a software that is used by broswers to let us run our JS natively on our computer. Since JS was created we had to find a way to interpret JS to computer language. So at a time we had to have an engine to do so.... however we have different browsers and that did mean that we would need different engines. Enter Node JS, this is an environment that allows us to turn our JS into that machine code and this allows us to use JS on Mobile, and Backend instances (not just broswer). So node is our super hero that will help us, use JS in many other ways than what we once had. Another cool thing that I learned was that the V8 engine actually made JS faster. 

## Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

I am really looking forward to digging into the big 0 notation and the mock interviews, I did my best to start learning about the big o notation as early as I could and I kind of understand it but I would like to see how that could help me improve the effeinecy of my code, and this ties with the other thing im interested in learning more about which is the interview process. Im not worried about the interview itself, however the idea of having a whiteboard to solve the problem and what do I do if I cant solve the problem is what is a huge worry for me. I will study my butt off and keep pressing on. 

## What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README? 

I am looking forward to creating an express server. I know we did this in 301 but its something that everytime we did it or reviewed it, I would learn something new.

## Things I want to know more about
