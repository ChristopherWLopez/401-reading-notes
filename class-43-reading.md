# Class 43 reading

This reading was about constributing to open source projects. Some of the reading really made this a fun process. Its almost like spending about year working on swinging the baseball bat, but now i finally get a chance to go out and play with others.

The growth and fun one is able to experience is probaly pretty amazing, i love the idea of being able to get feed back from others and learn different methods when it comes to writing code.

not only am i able to add to these projects but i am able to make a name for myself in in the real world, this is something that job recruiters are able to see and thus making me look much better
